About Hangman

This Hangman game is based entirely off the rock and roll genre of music and is an application that allows for your basic game of hangman with a few extras added in. The user is able to utilize the buttons on the screen to call letters or the the user can use the keyboard. This app uses an html canvas to draw out the hangman upon each wrong answer. If the user guesses all the letters right before the hangman is drawn out then the a song will play from the band name guessed.
